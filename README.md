# DragonAttacker

**DragonAttacker** is a tool designed to simulate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. It can send a large volume of UDP packets to a target, potentially causing network disruption. This tool is for educational purposes only, and should **never** be used to attack any network or website without explicit permission.

### ⚠️ Important Note
- **Do not use** this tool on unauthorized systems or networks. Unauthorized DDoS attacks are illegal and unethical.
